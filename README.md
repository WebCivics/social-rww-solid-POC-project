# social - RWW Legacy Project...
A RWW-Social Networking UI (solid). 

#History
Existing version (as is now) was uploaded to my webserver http://dev.webcivics.org/ back on Wed, 21 Jan 2015 at 05:33:59 GMT ([See HTTP headers](http://dev.webcivics.org/) ).

#BackGround
This was after others in the RWW community had started on some apps; but very early days, indeed seemingly before the [solid.mit.edu website](https://web.archive.org/web/20160815000000*/https://solid.mit.edu/) was started.  At the time, RWW (now called solid) only used [webid-tls](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/) and the works on [rww](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rww/), [webid](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webid/) and in-turn also - [Web-Payments](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/) where the requirements to improve 'capabilities' (putting it simply) for what was then called RWW, led to the creation of [credentials](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/) and in-turn various other related projects.

#Project Concept

This project seeks to both; finish something the app that was started in 2015 (although, previous attempts exist) - in a way, that works with present-day 'solid servers' (nb: See Both Historical & recent [solid related projects via this link](https://github.com/WebCivics/solid-stuff).  )

and in-turn; 
- support further dev on 'solid/rww related' works; and,
- establish what is required to [webize](https://www.w3.org/community/webize/) other 'html templates'
Online Marketplaces offer [HTML Templates](https://themeforest.net/category/site-templates) that should be able to be converted into 'solid' (rww or 'webizen') apps, fairly easily.  Yet, this is an 'idea' that is yet to be proven (even now, so many years later); so, this project seeks to both - deliver a functional version of a vision that was illustrated now so many years ago; and, in-turn, figure out what else needs to be done to get these sorts of things working better, for average people, looking for better solutions.  

#Resources Repo

#Pages UI toolkit - Licensing
THe original 'toolkit' comes from https://pages.revox.io/dashboard/ and if you want to make your own project with this 'kit', you'll need to go license a copy.

#Note: The implications of Decentralisation
There are many implications brought about as a consequence of the way decentralised applications - work.  Yet, it is difficult to have a good / sensible / productive conversation about these sorts of implications; if no-one has seen or used applications that work in ways that are different to both desktop & 'cloud' apps today.
